## Tips for Learning by Doing

1. **Start ugly** — get it working first, then refactor
2. **No tutorials** — use only documentation (React docs, MDN)
3. **Debug yourself** — spend 30 min stuck before searching
4. **Add features** — extend each project beyond the basics
5. **Revisit early projects** — refactor with new knowledge
6. **Deploy everything** — use Vercel or Netlify to see your work live
